# AN APPLICATION OF BENFORD'S LAW USING PYTHON

The basics here are taken from Lee Vaughan's excllent book `Impractical Python`. It allows for a Benford analysis of numbers in a pre-wrangled `.txt` file. I've already uploaded a bunch of samples - mostly, state vote counts broken down by county (or parish in LA). 


### DISCLAIMER 

THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF FRAUD IN THE 2020 ELECTION - but you are welcome to try to find it!
